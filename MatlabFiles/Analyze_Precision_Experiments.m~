%Analyze_Precision_Experiments looks at precision testing and bin testing
%from trials with 6 subjects (Sistania, Brian, Phil, Ray, Daniel, and
%Antonio

%Purpose: 
%   1) Show precision in distinguishing between activation
%   percentages for subjects given an activation target
%   
%   2) Check how precision changes as biofeedback becomes more or less
%   sensitive


%% Pull data from each subjet's trials

% Steps

%Begin with Sistania
