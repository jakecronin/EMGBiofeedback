# EMGBiofeedback

This is a system to display biofeedback data to subjects through a VR headset. 

The system uses LabView, Matlab, and Unity VR which includes some c++ code. 

The purpose of this software is to make co-contraction experiments both more precise and easier to conduct. 

The most challenging aspect of this project was integrating several different systems for data collection, processing, and display. Beginning this project with no knowledge of LabView, Matlab, or Unity, let alone EMG data processing,I am proud to have designed and built this biofeedback from scratch.
